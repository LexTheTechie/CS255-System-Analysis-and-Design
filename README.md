# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a system that the client, Liam, wanted to create to assist people with passing their drivers test. The system was to provide online practice tests and exams along with in person driving packages to those that needed the assistance. Liam wanted us to design a cloud based web application that could be accessed by any device with interent access. 

What did you do particularly well?
I did well with the systems design document as this document focused on putting the design on paper. This document included use case diagrams to describe what the system needed to do and the systems interaction with the users and outside systems. The next two diagrams that were included were sequence and activity diagram that further described the process that the user and system would go through for a given use case. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise my business requirements document as the format is very bulletted and that can often be seen as informal. I would type my reponses in paragraph form or in a structure so that the document does not appear so bulletted and informal. I would also put more thought into my limitationas as the ones that are listed are somewhat basic. However, it was difficult for me to think about limitations of the project as a whole without actually doing the work to create the project. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I knew that the main need of the user would be a user friendly system. They would need to login, access information, and manage purchased driver packages and information. Because of this, the user does not have much access to the technical ins and outs of the system. While most users would like the full access that allows the user to fix things themselves, this can sometimes get complicated which is why many issues that can arise with purchases and access are being resolved by staff awith the client. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are half of who we are designing the system for. What good is a system that works great for the client but does not work for the users at all?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Right now, I apporoach designing software with some sort of idea of what is needed and start coding first. Going forward, I will now begin with a system design document. I have leanred that the system design document pretty much spells out your code up to a point if done correctly. Your use case diagram leads you to a UML class diagram that breaks down what functions you need each object to perform. This can then translate to classes and methods in your code.
